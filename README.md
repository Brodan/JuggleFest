This repository contains my solution to [Yodle](http://www.yodle.com/)'s [Juggling Programming Puzzle](http://www.yodlecareers.com/programming-puzzle-juggling).

This solution was written using Java v1.7.0.

To run locally:
1. `git clone https://github.com/Brodan/JuggleFest.git`
2. `javac *.java`
3. `java Yodle jugglefest.txt`

This will create the output file `output.txt` as well as print the challenges solution (an email address) to the terminal.
